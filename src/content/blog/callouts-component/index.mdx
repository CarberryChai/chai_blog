## Our (hesitantly) first content-based component

This new version of astro-erudite, v1.5.0, introduces our first content-based component: the callout! I was a bit hesitant about adding this component because, frankly, the entire philosophy behind this project was to be as minimalistic as possible—I wanted to simply provide boilerplate to remove the "busy work" factor that often takes away from the writing process.

However, just based on some blog posts I've seen that use this template, I felt like there would be a universal desire just to have this component around in the case where it'd be needed. The primary inspiration came when user [@rezaarezvan](https://github.com/rezaarezvan) sent in a PR to add their site, [rezaarezvan.com](https://rezaarezvan.com), to the examples section in the README. They had years upon years of accumulated notes and resources on their site, most of which were in the form of LaTeX-style academic content that requires "blocks" for things like definitions, theorems, and proofs. I sent in an encouraging reply to the PR and then started building the component:

> [[@jktrn]](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite/pull/29#issuecomment-2814894034) your blog posts are literally insane btw @rezaarezvan how have you written multiple textbooks worth of educational resources???
>
> i think i might add latex-style theorem/lemma/corollary/def/proof/eg/ex/remark blocks to astro-erudite so i can accommodate for these academia-style blogs, like e.g. for exercises it'd just be a component with an expandable section to hide the answer

### How does it work?

I've added a simple `Callout.astro` to `src/components` that now comes shipped with the template. It's a very easy-to-read component that has an insanely long configuration scheme for all of the different types of callouts that I've added. Fundamentally, it follows the same paradigm as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) which uses [class-variance-authority](https://cva.style/docs) to create different "variants" on top of a base styling scheme:


Callout only supports three props:

| Prop | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `title` | The title of the callout | `undefined{:js}` |
| `variant` | The variant of the callout | `"note"{:js}` |
| `defaultOpen` | Whether the callout `<details>{:html}` box is open by default | `true{:js}` |

I've added an insane amount of variants to this component for potentially any use case you could think of. For the more general ones, you can use the following:



## Generic callouts

These are what the generic callouts look like (of course, all the text is made up):

<Callout title="Prerequisites for advanced React development" variant="note">
  This tutorial assumes you're familiar with React hooks and the component lifecycle. If you need a refresher, check out the [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) before proceeding.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Productivity enhancement" variant="tip">
  You can quickly format your code by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Mac).
  
  Additional shortcuts include:
  
  | Action | Windows/Linux | Mac |
  | ------ | ------------- | --- |
  | Search | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> | <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> |
  | Replace | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> | <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> |
  | Save all | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> | <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> |
</Callout>

<Callout title="Cross-browser compatibility issues" variant="warning">
  This API is **not supported** in Internet Explorer and has limited support in older browsers. Make sure to include appropriate polyfills.
  
  ```js
  if (!Object.fromEntries) {
    Object.fromEntries = function(entries) {
      const obj = {};
      for (const [key, value] of entries) {
        obj[key] = value;
      }
      return obj;
    };
  }
  ```
  
  See the [Browser Compatibility Table](#) for detailed information.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Critical data loss risk" variant="danger">
  Running this command will **permanently delete** all files in your current directory. Make sure to back up important data before proceeding.
  
  ```bash title="danger.sh"
  # This will delete everything in the current directory
  rm -rf ./*
  # Safer alternative with confirmation
  rm -ri ./*
  ```
  
  This operation cannot be undone and recovery tools may not be able to restore your data.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Major API changes in v2.0" variant="important">
  Version 2.0 introduces significant API changes. You'll need to update your existing code to use the new parameter structure.

  1. The `configure(){:js}` method now returns a Promise
  2. Authentication requires an API key object instead of a string
  3. Event handlers use a new callback pattern
  
  A migration example looks like the following:
  ```diff lang="js"
  - app.configure("api-key-string");
  + await app.configure({ key: "api-key-string", version: "2.0" });
  
  - app.on('event', callback);
  + app.on('event', { handler: callback, options: { once: true } });
  ```
</Callout>

## Mathematical callouts

Like I mentioned before, some of these variants are meant to be nested within each other. Take, for example, the following:

<Callout title="Continuous function" variant="definition">
  A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ between topological spaces is continuous if for every open set $V \subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V) \subseteq X$ is open in $X$.
  
  <Callout title="Equivalent formulations" variant="explanation">
    For metric spaces, continuity can be characterized by: $\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$ such that $d_X(x,y) < \delta \implies d_Y(f(x),f(y)) < \varepsilon$. This captures the intuition that points close to each other in $X$ map to points close to each other in $Y$.
  </Callout>
</Callout>

<Callout title="Law of Large Numbers" variant="theorem">
  Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with expected value $\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \mu < \infty$. Then for any $\varepsilon > 0$:
  $$
    \lim_{n \to \infty} P\left(\left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i - \mu\right| > \varepsilon\right) = 0
  $$
  
  <Callout title="Proof" variant="proof">
    We'll prove this using Chebyshev's inequality. Let $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$ and $\sigma^2 = \text{Var}(X_i)$. By Chebyshev's inequality:
    $$
      P\left(\left|\frac{S_n}{n} - \mu\right| \geq \varepsilon\right) \leq \frac{\text{Var}(S_n/n)}{\varepsilon^2}
    $$
    
    Since the variables are independent, we have:
    $$
      \text{Var}(S_n/n) = \frac{\text{Var}(S_n)}{n^2} = \frac{n\sigma^2}{n^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
    $$
    
    Substituting this into our inequality:
    $$
      P\left(\left|\frac{S_n}{n} - \mu\right| \geq \varepsilon\right) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{n\varepsilon^2}
    $$
    
    As $n \to \infty$, the right side approaches 0, which proves the theorem.
  </Callout>
</Callout>

<Callout title="Monotone Convergence Theorem" variant="lemma">
  Let $(f_n)$ be a sequence of non-negative measurable functions such that $f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and almost all $x$. Define $f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)$. Then:
  $$
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \, d\mu = \int f \, d\mu
  $$
  
  <Callout title="Proof" variant="proof">
    Let $g_n = f_n \cdot \chi_E$ where $E = \{x : f(x) < \infty\}$. By Fatou's lemma:
    $$
      \int f \, d\mu = \int \lim_{n \to \infty} g_n \, d\mu \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int g_n \, d\mu = \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \, d\mu
    $$
    
    For the reverse inequality, note that $f_n \leq f$ for all $n$, so $\int f_n \, d\mu \leq \int f \, d\mu$. Taking the limit:
    $$
      \limsup_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \, d\mu \leq \int f \, d\mu
    $$
    
    Combining these inequalities:
    $$
      \int f \, d\mu \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \, d\mu \leq \limsup_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \, d\mu \leq \int f \, d\mu
    $$
    
    Therefore, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \, d\mu = \int f \, d\mu$.
  </Callout>

I'll add this little subgenre of variant called "example-based" callouts that have more generally a question-answer format. For the "exercise-answer" pairing, the difference is that I'd recommend you default the answer to a closed state to hide the answer from any peeping readers until they've actually done the work themselves. Typically, the difference between an "Answer" and a "Solution" is that the answer basically just gives you the final answer, while the solution will show you the steps it takes to get to the answer:

<Callout title="Finding the derivative of a product function" variant="exercise">
  Calculate the derivative of $f(x) = x^3 \sin(x)$ using the product rule.
  
  <Callout variant="answer" defaultOpen={false}>
    $$
      \frac{d}{dx}[x^3 \sin(x)] = 3x^2 \sin(x) + x^3 \cos(x)
    $$
  </Callout>
</Callout>

<Callout title="Convergence of arithmetic means" variant="problem">
  Prove that if a sequence $(a_n)$ converges to $L$, then the sequence of arithmetic means $(\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n}{n})$ also converges to $L$.
  
  <Callout title="Detailed proof" variant="solution">
    Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. Since $(a_n)$ converges to $L$, there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|a_n - L| < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ for all $n \geq N$. Let $S_n = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n}{n}$ be the sequence of arithmetic means.
    
    We can split $S_n$ as follows:
    $$
    S_n = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_N + a_{N+1} + \ldots + a_n}{n}
    $$
    
    For $n > N$, we have:
    $$
    \begin{align*}
      |S_n - L| &= \left|\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n}{n} - L\right| \\
      &= \left|\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n - nL}{n}\right| \\
      &= \left|\frac{(a_1 - L) + (a_2 - L) + \ldots + (a_n - L)}{n}\right| \\
      &\leq \frac{|a_1 - L| + |a_2 - L| + \ldots + |a_N - L| + |a_{N+1} - L| + \ldots + |a_n - L|}{n}
    \end{align*}
    $$
    
    Let $M = \max\{|a_1 - L|, |a_2 - L|, \ldots, |a_N - L|\}$. Then:
    $$
      |S_n - L| \leq \frac{NM + (n-N)\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}{n} = \frac{NM}{n} + \frac{n-N}{n} \cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
    $$
    
    As $n \to \infty$, $\frac{NM}{n} \to 0$ and $\frac{n-N}{n} \to 1$. So for sufficiently large $n$, we have:
    $$
      |S_n - L| < \varepsilon
    $$
    
    Therefore, the sequence of arithmetic means converges to $L$.
